# DumpHDB
An Hex Dump tool that is a valid alternative to od, made as one of my first C programs.
It uses only C Standard Libraries so it should be compatible with every device and architecture that supports them.
# Compile
## You need to install GCC.
In order to compile DumpHDB you need to go in the scripts dir and select your os folder, then simply run the compile script and the executable will be put in the same folder.
After this you just need to open a console and run it with the needed args.
### Compile Script Path: DumpHDB/scripts/<os>("windows" or "linux")/compile.(sh or bat)

## Use dumphdb -h to display the help page.
